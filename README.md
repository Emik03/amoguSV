> "The ultimate community-driven and open-source competitive SV plugin"

This is a plugin for [Quaver](https://github.com/Quaver), the ultimate community-driven and open-source competitive rhythm game.
The plugin provides various tools to place, edit, and delete SVs (Scroll Velocities) quickly and efficiently when making maps.

## Installation
1. Click on the green Code button, then click Download ZIP
2. Extract the downloaded ZIP file to get the amoguSV-main folder
3. Move the amoguSV-main folder into the Plugins folder (located in the Quaver folder)

## Plugin Overview 
amoguSV makes working with SVs quick and easy!

Once you open the plugin in the map editor you
1. Choose an SV tool
2. Adjust the SV tool's settings
3. Select notes you want to use the tool at/between
4. Use the SV tool by pressing 'T' on your keyboard (or hitting the big button that appears)

amoguSV lets you do 3 general SV actions: place SVs, edit SVs, and delete SVs.

## Special Note
Most of the core ideas and base functionality were taken (stolen) from [iceSV](https://github.com/IceDynamix/iceSV) by [IceDynamix](https://github.com/IceDynamix).
Other SV ideas also taken (stolen) from [Illuminati-CRAZ](https://github.com/Illuminati-CRAZ)’s SV plugins.
Without these two people’s contributions to SV plugins in general, amoguSV would not be as good as it is today or even exist in the first place, so huge thanks to them.

Also, some cursor effects were inspired (stolen) from https://github.com/tholman/cursor-effects
